    <div class="section">
      <h2>📜 Our Journey Begins - 2023</h2>
      <p>It all started in a small college dorm room in early 2023. A group of three friends—Mohit, Vikas, and Armaan—faced a common issue: they constantly lost track of their online orders from different platforms. Frustrated by the confusion caused by courier websites, they decided to build a simple tool to help themselves and their classmates.</p>

      <p>What started as a small PHP script hosted on a free server quickly became popular across campus. Word spread fast, and students from other universities started using the tool. They called it “TrackIt.”</p>

      <h2>🌐 Going Public - 2024</h2>
      <p>After six months of testing, TrackIt officially launched in mid-2024. With a sleek redesign and real-time courier API integration, it became a fully functional web app. Within the first month, over 5,000 users signed up.</p>

      <p>Partnerships were formed with logistics companies to improve accuracy, and features like mobile tracking and SMS updates were added. The team expanded, bringing in front-end and back-end developers to scale the platform.</p>
